/** --------  Description ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * AD5292 is a digital potentiometer with 10-bits of resolution
 *
 * Full scale resistance is 10K, 20K, or 100K

  When new and nothing has been programmed into eeprom,
  it is set at 50% = 10K . Since we have resistors above and below it to set the min and max
  range, the set point is not just a linear function of the pot value. For example
  with R1 = 75K and R7 = 120 ohms, the Rpot of zero gives 5 mA drive,
  50% Rpot gives 196 mA, and 100% gives 349 mA.
  This makes things more complicated than a simple DAC, but also lets us scale the output
  range in ways that would be harder with a DAC.

  With the ADDR input grounded our device 7-bit address is B0101111 and since Arduino Wire
  library expects a 7-bit address it should be happy with that.
  Commands are sent msb first, upper two bits are 00 then a 4-bit command, then 10 bits of data;
  16 bits total. For the 8-bit AD5292 the two lsb of data are don't care.

 Commands:
 00 0001 [10-bit data] writes the data to the RDAC. This can be done unlimited times.

The AD527[2|4] has one address pin which controls the two lsb of the address.
ADDR	I2C base
GND 	0x2F
Vdd 	0x2C
N/C 	0x2E (unipolar power only)
